These folders contain a collection of statistical applications built using R and Shiny. Each application demonstrates different statistical techniques (parametric & non-parametric), 
allowing users to input data, adjust parameters, and visualize results in real-time.

These Shiny applications provide an interactive way apply statistical techniques, making the folder a valuable resource for students, educators, and data analysts.

Note: These Shiny applications are regularly updated to improve functionality, add new features, and ensure compatibility with the latest statistical practices.

To run a Shiny app in R, first ensure the shiny package is installed using install.packages("shiny"), then load it with library(shiny). If the app is written as an R script (app.R), use runApp("path/to/app.R"). Running these commands in the R console will start a local server, opening the app in a web browser.

To run a Shiny app in RStudio, first ensure the shiny package is installed with install.packages("shiny"), and then load it using library(shiny). If your app is in a single script (app.R), simply open the file in RStudio and click the Run App button in the upper-right corner of the script editor. Alternatively, you can run the app directly from the console using runApp("path/to/app.R") or runApp("path/to/folder"). This will start the app in a local server and open it in a web browser.
